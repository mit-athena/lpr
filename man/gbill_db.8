.SH NAME
gbill_db \- generate bills from the print quota database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gbill_db
[
.B groups file
]
[
.B database
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Gbill_db
generates bills for groups for the print quota service. The groups file 
is an ascii file containing bursar account numbers and group id numbers
in this format:
.IP
account_number:group_id
.PP
The complete path for the group file must be given if it's not in the 
current directory. Substituting /dev/null for this file will produce 
error messages containing id numbers for all groups that require a bill.
.PP
The database argument is likewise the complete path of the database
unless it's in the current directory. Only the root name is needed.
All suffixes are automatically dealt with.
.PP
This operation will produce a file named bursar_groupXXXXXX
in the /tmp directory. This contains the all groups that require bills
with appropriate amounts to be billed in proper formats to be 
sent to the bursars.

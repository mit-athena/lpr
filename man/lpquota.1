.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lpquota
is the client that interacts with the Quota Server, allowing users to
determine their printing usage as well as get a list of all times that
they have printed. For the privileged user and group account
administrators, this client also allows manipulation of the quota database.
.PP
The
.B \-Pprinter
option forces use of the quota server associated with a specific printer. 
If you do not specify a printer using the
.B -Pprinter
option, and the 
.B -Qquotaserver 
option is not used, 
the printer name contained in the environment variable
.B PRINTER 
is used.
.PP
The 
.B \-I
option asks the quota server for a status. This can be used to determine
if the server is running.
.B
The
.B \-Qquotaserver
can be used to explicitly specify the machine that the
quota server is running on.
.PP
The
.B \-aaccount
is used to specify an operation on a group account number instead of a
user. Only account administrators and the group's administrators can 
display the group's usage.
.PP
The following single letter specify options to the program.
.IP \fB\-q\fP 5
Display a users Print Quota and associated charges
.IP \fB\-l\fP 5
Display a complete log of all print activity for the particular user.
.PP
The following options are only available to an account administrator. 
All amounts are specified in cents.
.IP \fB\-c\fP 5
Create the user/group in the Quota Database
.IP \fB\-i\fP 5
Increases the users/groups quota limit
.IP \fB\-d\fP 5
Decrease the users/groups quota limit
.IP \fB\-s\fP 5
Sets the users/groups quota limit
.IP \fB\-k\fP 5
Adjusts the users/groups actual usage. This is to be used in giving a
user/group credit for poor quality printouts.
.PP
The following options are available to the account administrator and the
group's administrators. These options require a username.
.PP
.IP \fB\+A\fP 5
Adds a user to the group administrator list
.IP \fB\-A\fP 5
Removes a user from the group administrator list
.IP \fB\+U\fP 5
Adds a user to the group user list
.IP \fB\-U\fP 5
Removes a user from the group user list
.PP
The 
.B \-S 
option is to allow alternate quota services to be used. Currently the
default and only useful one is 
.B athena,
although other services may be registered to create restricted access
for a class of printer.
.PP
The 
.B \-f 
followed by either 0 or 1 disallows or allows a user to print on a
specific printer.
.PP
To find out the page cost for a given printer, one should use the 
.B \-l
option to lpq.

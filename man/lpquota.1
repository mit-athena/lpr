.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lpquota
is the client that interacts with the Quota Server, allowing users to
determine their printing usage as well as get a list of all times that
they have printed. For the privileged user, this client also allows
manipulation of the quota database.
.PP
The
.B \-Pprinter
option forces use of the quota server associated with a specific printer. 
If you do not specify a printer using the
.B -Pprinter
option, and the 
.B -Qquotaserver 
option is not used, 
the printer name contained in the environment variable
.B PRINTER 
is used.
.PP
The
.B \-Qquotaserver
can be used to explicitly specify the machine that the
quota server is running on.
.PP
The following single letter specify options to the program.
.IP \fB\-q\fP 5
Display a users Print Quota and associated charges
.IP \fB\-l\fP 5
Display a complete log of all print activity for the particular user.
.IP \fB\-c\fP 5

.PP
The following options which are only available for an administrator, all
take an amount which is in cents.
.IP \fB\-i\fP 5
Increases the users quota limit
.IP \fB\-d\fP 5
Decrease the users quota limit
.IP \fB\-s\fP 5
Sets the users quota limit
.IP \fB\-a\fP 5
Adjusts the users actual usage. This is to be used in giving a user
credit for poor quality printouts.
.PP
The 
.B \-S 
option is to allow alternate quota services to be used. Currently the
default and only useful one is 
.B athena,
although other services may be registered to create restricted access
for a class of printer.
.PP
The 
.B \-f 
followed by either 0 or 1 disallows or allows a user to print on a
specific printer.

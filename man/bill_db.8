.I Bill_db
generates bills for the print quota service. The names file is an ascii
file containing names, social security numbers and student vs faculty
flags in this format:
.IP
name:soc_security:flag
.PP
The complete path must be given if it's not in the current directory.
Substituting /dev/null for this file will produce error messages for
all users that require a bill.
.PP
The database argument is likewise the complete path of the database
unless it's in the current directory. Only the root name is needed.
All suffixes are automatically dealt with.
.PP
This operation will produce two files named bursar_studentsXXXXXX
and bursar_facultyXXXXXX in the /tmp directory. These contain all 
users that require bills with appropriate amounts to be billed in 
proper formats to be sent to the bursars.

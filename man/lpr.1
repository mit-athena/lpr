.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Lpr
prints the named files when facilities become available.  If no names appear,
the standard input is assumed.
.PP
The
.B \-Pprinter
option forces output to a specific printer. 
For example, to print a copy of the file cows on the printer helios,
you would use the command
.PP
lpr -Phelios cows
.PP
A listing of available printers and their capabilities can be found in
.IR printers(7),
or in the Athena Document
.I Printing from an Athena Workstation.
If you do not specify a printer using the
.B -Pprinter
option,
the printer name contained in the environment variable
.B PRINTER 
is used.  If 
.B PRINTER
is not set, the default printer for the
cluster whose name is contained in the environment variable 
.B LPR
is
used.
If
.B LPR
is not set, the default printer for the local cluster is used.
.PP
The following single letter options notify the line printer
spooler that the files are not standard text files. The spooling daemon will
use the appropriate filters to print the data accordingly.
.IP \fB\-p\fP 5
Use
.IR pr (1)
to format the files (equivalent to
.IR print ).
.IP \fB\-t\fP 5
The files are assumed to contain data from
.IR troff (1)
(cat phototypesetter commands).
.IP \fB\-n\fP 5
The files are assumed to contain data from
.I ditroff
(device independent troff).
.IP \fB\-c\fP 5
This option is currently disabled.
Previously,
it activated landscape mode for LN01 printers.
(When an LN01 printer is in landscape mode,
it prints horizontally along the long dimension as opposed to
the short dimension of the paper.)
You can now print in landscape mode on any POSTSCRIPT printer using
.I enscript(1).
.IP \fB\-f\fP 5
Use a filter which interprets the first character of each line as a
standard FORTRAN carriage control character.
.PP
The remaining single letter options have the following meaning.
.IP \fB\-r\fP 5
Remove the file upon completion of spooling or upon completion of
printing (with the \fB\-s\fP option).
.IP \fB\-h\fP 5
Suppress the printing of the burst page.
.IP \fB\-z\fP 5
Notify via Zephyr on job completion.
.IP \fB\-s\fP 5
Use symbolic links.  Usually files are copied to the spool directory.
.IP \fB\-u\fP 5
Disable sending of kerberos authentication to print server.
.IP \fB\-k\fP 5
Send kerberos authentication to print server. This option should never
be necessary, as the printcap information will be used to determine if
the option needs to be used.
.PP 
The
.B \-C
option takes the following argument as a job classification
for use on the burst page.  For example,
.PP
.ti +0.5i
lpr \-C EECS foo.c
.PP
causes the system name (the name returned by
.IR hostname (1))
to be replaced on the burst page by EECS,
and the file foo.c to be printed.
.PP
The
.B \-J
option takes the following argument as the job name to print on the burst page.
Normally, the first file's name is used.
.PP
The
.B \-T
option uses the next argument as the title used by
.IR pr (1)
instead of the file name.
.PP
To get multiple copies of output, use the
.BI \-# num
option,
where
.I num
is the number of copies desired of each file named.  For example,
.PP
.ti +0.5i
lpr \-#3 foo.c bar.c more.c
.PP
would result in 3 copies of the file foo.c, followed by 3 copies
of the file bar.c, etc.  On the other hand, 
.PP
.ti +0.5i
cat foo.c bar.c more.c | lpr \-#3
.PP
will give three copies of the concatenation of the files.
.PP
The
.B \-s
option will use
.IR symlink (2)
to link data files rather than trying to copy them so large files can be
printed.  This means the files should
not be modified or removed until they have been printed.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If you try to spool too large a file, it will be truncated.
.I Lpr
will object to printing binary files.
If a user other than root prints a file and spooling is disabled,
.I lpr
will print a message saying so and will not put jobs in the queue.
If a connection to
.I lpd
on the local machine cannot be made,
.I lpr
will say that the daemon cannot be started.
Diagnostics may be printed in the daemon's log file
regarding missing spool files by
.IR lpd .
.SH BUGS
Fonts for
.I troff
reside on the host with the printer.

Account numbers for authenticated printing are not supported yet.
